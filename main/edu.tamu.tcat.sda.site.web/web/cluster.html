                                            <p>The Ian Ramsey Centre for Science and Religion (IRC) at Oxford University is pleased to offer three cluster group awards of up to <strong>US$15,000</strong> each to catalyse the formation of interdisciplinary discussion groups that will (a) bring diverse groups of scholars from sciences and the humanities together to discuss and debate questions related to Special Divine Action (SDA), and (b) host outside speakers to meet with these discussion groups.</p>
                                            <p>Grants will be awarded by competitive evaluation on the basis of proposals. Letters of intent must be received by the IRC no later than <strong>January 16, 2015</strong>. Complete proposals are due by <strong>March 15, 2015</strong>, with final award winners informed by <strong>March 30, 2015</strong>.
                                            <p>[please note extension of initial deadline date]</p>

                                        <h3 class="acc-trigger" id="section-2">Backgrounds and Topics</h3>
                                        <div class="acc-segment">
                                            <p>Is there special divine action (SDA) in the world, beyond the purported effects of a divine first cause? Beliefs about particular kinds of special divine action (such as incarnation, inspirations, grace, miracles, providence, and resurrection) have had an incalculable impact on civilisation, being some of the most important inspirations for art, ethics, music, literature, philosophy, social institutions, theology, the perception of nature, and what human beings can and should hope for. If there is SDA, however, what is such action like and how would we know? Are there particular ways of thinking about the world that make such actions probable, possible or impossible? How does contemporary research in philosophy, theology, and science bear on these questions? What tools of scholarship can and should be used? From the point of view of knowledge and human flourishing, or from a divine perspective, are there advantages and disadvantages for human persons to take a stance for or against the possibility of some or all modes of SDA?</p>
                                            <p>Applicants are free to select research topics on these or other issues across a broad range of matters regarding SDA, but are encouraged to draw up carefully a list of specific and focused questions that their groups propose to address. The following list of sample questions is intended to be strictly illustrative and is not in any way exhaustive:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>A prominent classical conception of SDA is an intervention model. What analyses of causation fit best with such a model? What problems need to be addressed on this model?</li>
                                                <li>Besides the intervention model, what other models of SDA might be viable? Are they compatible with an intervention model, so that there might be multiple types of SDA, or not? What benefits or drawbacks might there be to working with one of these alternative models?</li>
                                                <li>What are the useful categorisations of purported SDA? Do grace, inspiration, miracles, and providence cover the entire field of significant theological interest? What are the most appropriate metaphors? How do these varieties of purported SDA impact on perceptions of philosophical and scientific questions, and vice versa?</li>
                                                <li>What are the theological ramifications of adopting a non-interventionist model vis-à-vis those of adopting an interventionist model? Does this choice require rethinking other classical theological categories? Why or why not?</li>
                                                <li>Is SDA compatible with a strictly physicalist conception of nature? If so, how is it to be distinguished from instances of natural causation? If not, why not?</li>
                                                <li>How do views about the scope and limitations of SDA interact with views about the scope and limitations of human personal action?</li>
                                                <li>What resources might a dualist analysis (e.g. predicate, property, substance) of human mind-body interactions afford for the analysis of SDA? Are there problems for a dualist analysis that carry over to certain construals of SDA?</li>
                                                <li>Is rareness a prerequisite for the religious significance of special divine action? Why or why not? How would the idea that such instances are rare affect the Humean argument against reported miracles from the observed uniformity of nature?</li>
                                                <li>What is the proper analysis of special providences – events that, though describable wholly in natural terms, seem to exhibit a timing that is preternaturally auspicious? Is this a form of SDA, or should it be analysed in some other fashion?</li>
                                                <li>What is the proper analysis of prophecy? Is this (as Hume suggests) simply another way for the laws of nature to be violated, or is it something else? Under what conditions would it count as SDA? How would the epistemic questions of its evaluation differ from those for (say) turning water into wine or raising someone from the dead?</li>
                                                <li>Inspiration: what is the proper epistemic analysis of purported visions, or dreams, or inspiration? Is there a difference of a first-person (tasting a wine?) or third-person perspective? Can inspiration be second-personal? What are the appropriate metaphors for inspiration? What are the relationships among inspiration, perception and insight?</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>Applicants are encouraged to be creative in their proposals for addressing their chosen questions, but applications that propose to bring together key insights from diverse disciplines will be looked on favourably. Methods of analyses can also be wide-ranging. As the questions above illustrate, applicants may wish to consider the possibility and meaning of a generic kind SDA within a particular worldview, such as naturalism, determinism, occasionalism or informational perspectives on reality. Alternatively, they might want to explore hypothetical questions, such as, if a particular kind of SDA were to take place, would this SDA be recognizable as such, and what are the further implications? In addition, specific or paradigmatic cases of instances of purported SDA could be considered from two or more different disciplines. Along with analysis, they may also wish to examine issues pertaining to the impact and refinement of the metaphoric understanding of SDA.</p>
                                            <p>Favourable consideration will be given to clear, focused research topics and questions.

Journal articles and dissertations may be across a wide range of fields including, without being limited to, biology, epistemology, mathematics, neuroscience, philosophy, physics, psychology, religious studies, sociology, and theology; or (b) the syllabus for a course in or involving questions of SDA that follows on from the outcome of the seminars and which will be offered within the subsequent academic year.

      Is every action in the cosmos only an effect of some other action in the cosmos? Or is there something more? Is there divine action?
    content: >
      One fact is certain: belief in these special divine actions has had an immense impact on human society and civilisation. Such beliefs shape, often decisively, the way we think about the world, what we do in the world, and what we hope for now and in the future.

        panels:
          - - title: Grace
              href: /#!/about
              content: >
                Grace is associated with the idea of blessing, beauty, and salvation. The novel meaning of grace in theology is that of a seed in the ground of human nature, a transformation or second birth into a new life as a child of God.
            - title: Inspiration
              href: /#!/about
              content: >
                Inspiration is insight with a sense of divine illumination. This experience is like a light shining in darkness or a shift to a new and higher perspective, allowing us to see the things we know fit together in a new way.
          - - title: Miracles
              href: /#!/about
              content: >
                A miracle is an object of wonder without a natural cause, attributed to special divine action. Rather than ‘breaking the laws of nature’ in a machine-like cosmos, a miracle is better considered as exceeding the productive power of nature.
            - title: Providence
              href: /#!/about
              content: >
                Providence implies the notion of divine direction of cosmic and human affairs with wise benevolence. In a providential cosmos, time is not simply a succession of moments but has a more organic meaning, marking progress towards some fruitful goal.
      - title: Narratives

            - title: Theology and religion

          - - title: Philosophies of the world
              content: >
                Survey diverse philosophies of the world for framing the meaning and assessment of special divine action: materialism; determinism; indeterminism; hylomorphism; emergentism and holism; panpsychism; paradigms of physics; laws of nature; dualism; models of causation.
            - title: Historical development
              content: >
                View perspectives on special divine action over the history of philosophy and in the philosophy of history. Examine recurring issues including the problem of evil, and key commentators including Aquinas, Spinoza, Hume, Kant, Bolzero, Newman, and C. S. Lewis.

        panels:
          - - title: Encounter
              content: >
                Investigate the reported experiential and sometimes transformative aspects of encountering purported special divine action. These overviews also examine special questions regarding the weighing of evidence drawn from testimony and ways in which experience shapes faith and faith shapes experience.
            - title: Teaching
              content: >
                Enhance teaching in schools, colleges, universities and personal study with a suite of resources including animations, short video introductions, interviews, lectures at academic conferences, and two entire online courses by Prof. MrcGrew on the “Deist Controversy” and “The Great Debate”.

        panels:
          - - title: Watchmaker
              content: >
                Analyse the mechanistic worldview of early modern science and new biological discoveries that gave rise to the image of God as a watchmaker. Appreciate the influence, limitations, and criticisms of this metaphor, from philosophical, theological, and scientific perspectives.
            - title: Gardener
              content: >
                Stroll through the ‘Garden of God’ in Genesis, the Persian term ‘paradise,’ and the Father being the ‘vinedresser’ (John 15:1). Muse about divine action in the manner of a gardener in a philosophical story, the ‘Parable of the Garden’.
          - - title: Illuminator
              content: >
                See the power of illumination as a metaphor for divine inspiration and as an ancient theory of knowledge generally, such as Plato’s myth of the cave. Contemplate parallels and overlaps with new research into understanding, insight, and gestalt perception.
            - title: Spouse
              content: >
                Delight in the astounding and beautiful image of special divine action in the manner of a covenant, the espousal of the soul to God in the Song of Songs, and the Wedding Feast of the Lamb in the Book of Revelation.
